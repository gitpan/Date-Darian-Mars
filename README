NAME

Date::Darian::Mars - the Darian calendar for Mars

DESCRIPTION

The Darian calendar for Mars is a mechanism by which Martian solar days
(also known as "sols") can be labelled in a manner useful to inhabitants
of Mars.  This module provides functions to convert dates between the
Darian calendar and Chronological Mars Solar Day Numbers, which is a
suitable format to do arithmetic with.  It also supplies functions that
describe the shape of the Darian calendar, to assist in calendrical
calculations.  It also supplies functions to represent Darian dates
textually in a conventional format.

The Darian calendar divides time up into years, months, and days.
This module also supports dividing the Darian year directly into days,
with no months.

The Chronological Mars Solar Day Number is an integral number labelling
each Martian day, where the day extends from midnight to midnight in
whatever time zone is of interest.  It is a linear count of days, where
each day's number is one greater than the previous day's number.

This module places no limit on the range of dates to which it may be
applied.  All function arguments are permitted to be "Math::BigInt" or
"Math::BigRat" objects in order to achieve arbitrary range.  Native Perl
integers are also permitted, as a convenience when the range of dates
being handled is known to be sufficiently small.
